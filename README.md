# REST-API

Here I have made a REST API where we can store user details like name, age, phone number etc and we can get details of a specific user by its id. This api supports GET,POST,PUT,PATCH and DELETE  requests. For this api I have used node js ,express as backend and mongo db for database. I have used Postman for testing my REST API.
